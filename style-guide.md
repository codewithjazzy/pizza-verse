# Style Guide

Welcome to the Pizza Verse! This document is a general style to help you format your PR. Following it will ensure that itâ€™s presented at its best, just using the highest quality of ingredients to the best pizza! ðŸ˜Š

## Headings

- Only use the `h1` tags if youâ€™re creating a new file.
- Main titles should use the `h2` tag(e.g., ## Toppings)
- Sub-titles should use the `h3` tag (e.g., ### Types of Pepperoni)
- Headings should be written in Title case.

### Lists

- When adding a pizza fun fact to the list or describing the ingredients for a recipe, create unordered lists using dash (-).

### Links

- Use this syntax for links to webpages: `![alt text](url)]`.
- If you'd like to link hosted files such as images, or GIFs, please upload them to the [images folder](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/tree/main/images). Said images should be linked using the following url: "<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/main/images/>" followed by the imageâ€™s name.
- Avoid linking to sites such as Wikipedia due to its lack of quality control.
